## mehdi.co

Mehdi's [personal website](https://mehdi.co) running on React and Next.js.

### üõ†Ô∏è Built with:
- React 18
- Next.js 13
- [Chakra-ui](https://chakra-ui.com/) 
- [Framer motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)
- A bunch of [other packages](https://github.com/mehdiamrane/mehdi.co/blob/main/package.json)
- Deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)

### üìÑ Where's the content?

The content (markdown files) lives in a private github repo, and is linked here as a submodule. Vercel doesn't support private modules out of the box, so I used the [vercel-submodules package](https://github.com/junhoyeo/vercel-submodules?tab=readme-ov-file) to pull the content into the repo during builds.

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Notice

The source for this site was not created to be a template or theme, but for my own use. Feel free to take whatever inspiration from it that you want, but this code was not written with the intention of being cloned and deployed. As such, I do not provide support or guidance for doing that.
